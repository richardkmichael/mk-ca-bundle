## History

`mk-ca-bundle` is a command line tool that is shipped as part of every
curl and libcurl release (see http://curl.haxx.se/). It was originally
based on the parse‐certs script written by Roland Krikava and was later
much improved by Guenter Knauf. This manual page was written by Jan
Schaumann <jschauma@netmeister.org>.
